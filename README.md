# image-preds-tests
This project is essentially for my private learning use. Here, I will use a couple libraries of deep learning (what comes in mind is Pytorch and Keras, and probably Tensorflow) to compare results of CNN for image prediction. I decided to make this my knowledge repo on my chatbot project. So, there are a lot more scripts / models that will be tested here.

# Project Motivation
I'm building this for a personal project. Hence, this acts as my 'version control' instead of ready models. If you wish to run these notebooks, please do so by cloning the repo.

# Project Installation
To clone this project, use git clone https://github.com/nugroho1234/image-preds-tests.git

# Libraries
To run the project, I use:
1. Python 3.6
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Pytorch
5. Keras

# Project Note
The images I used in this project is images of bags, wallets, and glasses with their respected brands. I cannot share the images because of privacy issues. Therefore, if you would like to test this, you can build your own database with the folders:  
img  
--train  
----brand a  
----brand b
----brand c  

--valid  
----brand a  
----brand b
----brand c  

--test  
----brand a  
----brand b
----brand c  
And fill each brand directory with the items to your liking.

# Project Improvements
For now, I haven't been able to reproduce the result in the notebook if I upload it to a VPS server. Before I did my last training, I initialized a seed number. If you can improve on this, it would be helpful.

# Acknowledgements
The project uses images from an online shop which I should not mention the name.
