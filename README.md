# image-preds-tests
This project is essentially for my private learning use. Here, I will use a couple libraries of deep learning (what comes in mind is Pytorch and Keras, and probably Tensorflow) to compare results of CNN for image prediction.

# Project Motivation
I'm building this for a personal project. Hence, this acts as my 'version control' instead of ready models. If you wish to run these notebooks, please do so by cloning the repo.
